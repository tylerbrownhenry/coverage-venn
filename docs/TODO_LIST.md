# Test Coverage Analysis Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Component Analysis & TestID Generation

- [x] **Create Component Scanner**
  - [x] Build a utility to traverse the application source code
  - [x] Identify React components (functional and class-based)
  - [x] Extract component metadata (name, props, hooks used, event handlers)
  - [x] Determine component hierarchy relationships

- [x] **TestID Generation & Recommendation**
  - [x] Analyze existing testids in components
  - [x] Generate consistent testid recommendations for components missing them
  - [x] Create naming convention rules (e.g., `{componentName}-{elementType}`)
  - [x] For each component, recommend testids for interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)

- [x] **Store Component & TestID Data**
  - [x] Create a data structure to store component information
  - [x] Include file path, component name, existing testids, recommended testids
  - [x] Serialize this data to a JSON file in the project
  - [x] Example format:
    ```json
    {
      "components": [
        {
          "path": "src/components/Button.tsx",
          "name": "Button",
          "existingTestIds": ["submit-button"],
          "recommendedTestIds": ["button-wrapper", "button-icon"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Phase 2: Test Analysis

- [x] **Create Test Scanner**
  - [x] Build a utility to traverse all test files
  - [x] Identify test frameworks in use (Jest, React Testing Library, etc.)
  - [x] Extract test metadata (test name, test file path, assertions)

- [x] **Import Analysis**
  - [x] For each test file, analyze import statements
  - [x] Create mapping between tests and the components they import
  - [x] Store these relationships

- [x] **Tag & Feature Detection**
  - [x] Define a convention for tagging tests (e.g., `@feature:button`)
  - [x] Scan for test tags in comments or test descriptions
  - [x] Create mapping between components and their related test tags
  - [x] Store these relationships

- [x] **TestID Usage Analysis**
  - [x] Scan tests for queries that use testids
  - [x] Map which testids are used in which tests
  - [x] Identify unused testids and missing test coverage

    |--------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
    | src/components/Button.js | Button       | @ui:input | 12           | 94%        |
    | src/utils/formatters.js  | dateFormat   | @util     | 8            | 87%        |
    | src/pages/Login.js       | LoginForm    | @auth     | 5            | 62%        |
    ```
