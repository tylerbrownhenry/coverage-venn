## Test Correlation Viewer Enhancements

The Test Correlation Viewer has been enhanced with the following features:

### View Test Feature

A new "View Test" functionality has been added to the test correlation section. This feature:

1. **Interactive Test Code Viewer**: Clicking the "View Test" button displays a modal dialog showing the actual code of the corresponding test.

2. **Syntax Highlighting**: The test code is displayed with syntax highlighting and line numbers for better readability.

3. **Smart Highlighting**: The specific test scenario related to the component is automatically highlighted and scrolled into view.

4. **Modal Interface**: The test code is shown in a clean, modal interface that can be closed by clicking outside the modal or the "×" button.

5. **Dynamic Test Content**: The viewer dynamically generates test content based on the feature and scenario names, making it easy to understand the relationship between tests and components.

This enhancement helps developers understand the test coverage by allowing them to quickly inspect the actual test code without leaving the coverage report. It provides valuable context about how components are being tested and can help identify opportunities for improving test coverage.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

The coverage data structure has been enhanced to include:

```json
{
  "path": "src/components/Button.tsx",
  "coverage": {
    "unit": 85,
    "e2e": 70,
    "visual": 90,
    "runtime": 0
  },
  "statements": 85,
  "branches": 75,
  "functions": 90,
  "lines": 82,
  "sourceInfo": {
    "lineCount": 35,
    "coveredLines": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...],
    "uncoveredLines": [7, 21, 24, 28, 29]
  }
}
```

### Source Code Extraction

- Source code is extracted dynamically based on file paths
- For development/testing, mock source code is generated when real files are not available
- Coverage highlighting is applied based on the `coveredLines` and `uncoveredLines` data

### User Preference Storage

The user preference structure stored in localStorage:

```json
{
  "coverageFilter": "all",
  "testStatusFilter": "all",
  "sortOrder": "coverage-desc",
  "showDetails": true,
  "showSource": true,
  "showTestDetails": false,
  "expandedComponents": ["component-Button", "component-App"],
  "searchQuery": "button"
}
```

### Export Implementation

The export functionality is implemented as a post-processing script that adds the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the generated report:

- **Export Controls**: Added to the filter section of the report
- **Data Processing**: JavaScript functions extract and format data based on user selections
- **Format Conversion**: Helper functions convert data to JSON or CSV formats
- **File Download**: Uses the browser's download API to save files locally
- **Notification System**: Provides feedback when export is completed

### Interactive Source Code Implementation

The interactive source code features are added as a post-processing step:

- **Source Formatting**: Raw source code is processed to add line numbers and interactive elements
- **Block Detection**: Code blocks (functions, classes, etc.) are detected for collapsible sections
- **Event Handling**: Click and double-click events are added to each line
- **DOM Manipulation**: The source code display is enhanced with a toolbar and interactive controls
- **Visual Styling**: CSS is added for improved styling and visual feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Interactive Source Code**: ✅ Enable interactive elements in the source code view
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Further improve the mobile experience
3. **Visual Annotations**: Add more visual cues and annotations for coverage gaps
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize rendering for larger codebases with many components
5. **Sourcemap Integration**: Add sourcemap integration for accurate line mapping

## Usage

To generate the enhanced report:

```bash
npm run generate:report
```

To generate the report with export functionality:

```bash
npm run generate:report:with-export
```

To generate the report with interactive source code:

```bash
npm run generate:report:with-interactive
```

To generate the report with all enhancements:

```bash
npm run generate:report:full
```

The report will be generated at `coverage-mock/coverage.html`.
