# Babel Instrumentation Plugin Progress Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive Babel plugin for code instrumentation that provides advanced coverage tracking beyond what's possible with standard tools like Jest/Istanbul. Our plugin is designed to track fine-grained execution paths through JavaScript/React code, including conditional branches, JSX rendering, function executions, switch/case statements, and error handling paths.

## Completed Features

Our plugin now supports tracking the following code constructs:

### 1. Conditional Branch Tracking
- âœ… If/else statements
- âœ… Ternary expressions (`? :`)
- âœ… Logical expressions (`&&`, `||`) for conditional rendering
- âœ… Switch/case statements including fallthrough cases and default cases

### 2. JSX and Component Tracking
- âœ… JSX element rendering
- âœ… Conditional rendering patterns in JSX
- âœ… Element type tracking

### 3. Function Execution Tracking
- âœ… Function declarations
- âœ… Arrow function expressions
- âœ… Object methods
- âœ… Success/error path tracking
- âœ… Anonymous functions
- âœ… Async functions and promises
- âœ… Promise chain tracking (then/catch/finally)

### 4. Error Handling Tracking
- âœ… Try/catch blocks
- âœ… Finally blocks
- âœ… Nested try/catch structures
- âœ… Error propagation

### 5. Jest Integration
- âœ… Custom Jest environment
- âœ… Babel configuration for Jest
- âœ… Coverage data persistence
- âœ… Results aggregation across test files
- âœ… Enhanced HTML report generation with feature details

We have successfully addressed recursion issues and created a comprehensive reporting system. The project is now ready for further enhancements, such as TypeScript support, performance optimization, and improved visualization. 

# Running the Instrumentation Plugin and Viewing the Report

You can see the instrumentation plugin in action and generate a comprehensive report by running:

```bash
npm run coverage:instrumented:all
```

This command will:
1. Run your Jest tests with the instrumentation plugin enabled
2. Collect coverage data during test execution
3. Generate an HTML report with the collected data

## Where to Find the Report

After running the command, the HTML report will be generated at:

```
/Users/tylerhenry/Documents/GitHub/jogger/coverage-venn/coverage-instrumentation/report/index.html
```

To view the report, you can open it in your browser directly using:

```bash
open /Users/tylerhenry/Documents/GitHub/jogger/coverage-venn/coverage-instrumentation/report/index.html
```

## Alternative Commands

If you want to run specific parts of the process separately:

1. **Just run instrumented tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:instrumented
   ```

2. **Generate report from existing data**:
   ```bash
   npm run report:instrumented
   ```

3. **Run specific test files with instrumentation**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:instrumented -- __tests__/utils/string-utils.test.js
   ```

The generated report will contain comprehensive information about your code's execution paths, including branch coverage, function calls, JSX rendering, and error handling paths collected during testing. 

# Code Coverage Status Commands

You're right - the previous commands generate a summary of our implementation. For actual code coverage metrics showing percentages and coverage status, you have several options:

## Jest Standard Coverage Report

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This command runs your tests with Jest's built-in coverage and generates a detailed report showing:
- Percentage of lines covered
- Percentage of functions covered
- Percentage of branches covered
- Uncovered line numbers

The report will be generated in the `/Users/tylerhenry/Documents/GitHub/jogger/coverage-venn/coverage/` directory, with both HTML and JSON formats.

## View HTML Coverage Report

To view the HTML version of the standard coverage report:

```bash
open /Users/tylerhenry/Documents/GitHub/jogger/coverage-venn/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Get Coverage Summary

For a quick JSON summary of coverage metrics:

```bash
cat /Users/tylerhenry/Documents/GitHub/jogger/coverage-venn/coverage/coverage-summary.json
```

## Generate Custom Coverage Correlation

For our custom implementation that correlates component relationships with coverage:

```bash
npm run analyze:mock-coverage && npm run correlate:coverage && npm run generate:report
```

This runs our custom coverage analysis pipeline and provides insights into component relationships and test coverage correlation.

## Advanced Usage: Combined Report

If you want to get the best of both worlds (standard metrics + our custom instrumentation):

```bash
npm run test:coverage && npm run coverage:instrumented:all
```

This will generate both types of reports so you can compare the standard metrics with our enhanced tracking capabilities.
